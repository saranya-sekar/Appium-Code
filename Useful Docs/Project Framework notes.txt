1. Every page should be a separate class
2. Every action should be a separate method
3. Every method should have a return type and return to the page where it lands post completion of that action
4. Every page should extend or inherit the base or wrapper class
5. Verify the page it has been landed
6. Base class should be created with reusable or needed methods
